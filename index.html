### My New Year Thoughts of all VGM and Friends

### Setsuna Cross
##### Seven Judgement Guild Master

The Powerhouse of Seven Judgement.

Axel is sort of the type of person that could wipe countries if he wants to, but decided to be altruistic. As tyranny his title is, he's actually the most heartwarming leader that listens on the problems of others

If I were to look at the mirror, and wished to see the person I could idolize, and able to changed my principles and ways. It would be him.
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" data-background-image="fkiabt.png data-background-opacity='0.3'" -->

He had maintained the group for how many years that is, and it is amazing that it still goes strong even this year.

7J might be part of his strength, but as well as his own weakness of how he was affected by his mere members who abandoned the guild.
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" data-background-image="fkiabt.png data-background-opacity='0.3'" -->

I thanked him for his wisdom to become the person I aspired to be.

To no longer hide under a facade, and be myself.

To not judge a person, neither underestimating them.

To persevere in goodness, no matter what life throws at me.

He is the person I failed to become, yet still eager to become the best of my own.  

Thanks alot, Boss and as the dearest Guild Master caring for 7J ;D

### Gabzie
##### Seven Judgement Second VGM
- Gaby is drunk

Gabzie for me is like my uncle: funny, honest, drunk and horn- 

He's like a father that buys milk and be gone for like days. When he appears again, 7J returns to its lively chaotic state, welcoming him and sometimes consoling him if he comes back crying.

In all honesty, he's a great friend to have and have cute cats.

Ofc I'm thankful for him this year that I get to taste having the full power of his BWG Satt... which didn't lasted too long after mw released. Also he's rich, that I am able to bought dte weapons like I never had before. 

I wish Gaby a good luck towards his normie life, towards his endeavors, aspirations and to get that ass- I mean the love of his life. Thank you alot, Gabzie.

### Zeromi
##### Seven Judgement Founder
We haven't interacted much together, maybe it's because I joined after you retired or we don't have much in common... As much as banal as that sounds, I actually found Zeromi to have a domineering aura, but in actuality, this guy is pretty nice and kind after we played matches of ML. He greeted to me whenever we met up in game, and that is nice of its own. I hope you had a great day being once a VGM/GM of 7J, and I wish you can manage in your own guild with the profound experience!

I thanked Zeromi for the fun I had, and maybe without him, 7J wouldn't become 7J that is today.

### Dragoon
##### Seven Judgement Former VGM
- Logic is nonexistent
- Morality is meaningless

This guy is totally nuts and the most unexpected guy I've ever come across. Even if Dragoon acts over the top, I cannot ever find his existence annoying (idk this just for me), but rather finding him amusing and funny. He is an embodiment of fun and chaos blended together in which suits the total vibe of the Guild. 

He is the Socrates of 7J.

### Tomo
##### Seven Judgement Third VGM
- The Edge of TOMOrrow

I find Tomo the first time in 7J, a cute girl, because I've never entered been active in Discord but in game. 'she' attracted me with 'her' toram character much the way she dressed in each raids. I really do not know how Tomo perceives me as, am I his enemy? friend? I hopefully wish I've never been in his bad side after my continuous teasing when I butchered his name. I would welcome him nonetheless as he reminds me of that one friend.

### ZeroV2
##### Seven Judgement Fourth VGM
Peni or Shirou, is a knowledgeable guy and reliable if you wanna know intermediate stuffs in the game. Also a strong one at that. Tbh, the more I know Shirou, the more I see myself in him. A man who only feels fulfilled by the validation of others, purposefully affect others by my own sorrow so they could empathized with me, and impress every women I lay eyes on. Until I realized I can just be happy on my own. Sighs. I hope you manage your own problems without dragging or using others for your own good.

### Roko
##### Seven Judgement Fifth VGM

Aside from my excessive 'whistle baby' cyberbullying of Roko, he is genuinely a good admin who can do things done.  
I first expect he is just average when he applied for VGM, but that impression failed me. If there is a word I could describe Roko, it must be "Hardworking"

MF keeps on doing guild quest that there isn't a day I couldn't see him in #completed-gq section.
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" data-background-image="fkiabt.png data-background-opacity='0.3'" -->

I thanked Roko for applying for VGM when nobody has the courage to do it. 

The spot may be vacant if he hadn't willingly volunteered or the spot may be given to those who don't deserve it.

Hopefully, addressing Roko's melancholies, whatever problems you have, I wish you can overcome them. 

And become truly happy.

### Alex
##### Seven Judgement Sixth VGM

If Roko is "Hardwork", then Alex is "Kindness", the anchor that balances the chaos and insanity with innocence and joy.  

I would sus on Alex if she was actually cold hearted and apathetic in the inside. But seemingly, I cannot sense the counterpart in her as if she genuinely wants to help 7J.

Could definitely say she's a potential with her openness and understanding as a VGM.
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" data-background-image="fkiabt.png data-background-opacity='0.3'" -->

Her kindness in nature isn't so intoxicating, unlike the facade I had being a "nice guy". It's just being a people person for one another, and doesn't always expecting a return if they did so.

I am thankful for Alex in creating a portrait of my toram char and towards her character as a kind person. Even liking how she's not so overreacting towards our chaotic actions.

I hope you to become a professional drawerist someday, keep it up!

### Icy
##### Seven Judgement Seventh VGM

For you, is still the bottom of a barrel on which a character I still don't understand. Whether you are either cold, harsh, nice, strict, strict or whichever. 

I'm sure you just want to help the guild, confidently at that too. You know your stuffs, you solve guildmates' problems and they find it enjoyable so am I as well.

I couldn't get to say much so I apologies, maybe the fact you reminded me of a guy I disliked or I do not really know much about you aside from being an oldie. 

Thank you for being the last vgm we had this year.

Keep doing your job at the best of your abilities! I'm proud of ya.

Good luck and hopefully your relationship with Anne will last longer than eternity.

- I'm sorry for what I've done before, that certain trauma or incident that I know you still hated me for it.

- I'm glad you still are my friend up to today, thou we don't talk much often, but still thankful for it.

### AL Centil / RAI
##### Sword of Incandescence

- The first person I looked up to become powerful in guild raids. Because I kept seeing them in the raid ranking before, and very versatile from using 0hs to ths. Thou, quiet or  I rarely interacted with in the guild, but I can sense they're a heartwarming and wholesome person. ;D

- Thank you for the gifts btw, I thought you really left the guild as you sent me an xtal, it made me a bit sad- but glad you're still with us ^^

### Lucenzia
##### Elven Of Light

- The first person I liked inside the 7 Judgement Guild. (as friends duh)

- When we met, and talked, I was surprised when you invited me out at the beach event. So I made a run for it.. and realized I haven't even finished the quest to unlock the night version, so you patiently waited for me to reach you.

- I considered it a sweet moment when we exchanged our own personal problems while watching the fireworks at the horizon.
